## 🎯 Project Goals:
This is my first more meaningful project in C++ programming language. I wanted to play with some file parsing, system calls and cross-platform coding.

Over time I want to make it configurable by the user, make it work on wide range of operating systems (like FreeBSD, Android and MacOS) and I will introduce more christmas themed ASCII arts.
